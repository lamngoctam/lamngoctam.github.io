   I worked with <a href=https://jakelem.com>Jake Lem</a> and <a href=https://www.thytran316.com>Thy Tran</a> to apply the knowledge that we have learned in Computer Graphics course to create our personal take on the classic <a href=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us>Minecraft</a> game. Major concepts include GPU-CPU communication (vbos) with <b>OpenGL</b>, <b>C++ code organization and optimization</b>, game engine and game design. We used <b>Git</b> to manage and share our code. <br />
   <br />
   Our theme is Japanese painting, so we went for a ink color scheme with bamboo trees. My roles in the project were creating the terrain with <a href=https://thebookofshaders.com/13>Fractal Brownian Motion</a> noise algorithm. I also worked on <b>multithreading</b> for quicker terrain expansion, player swimming motion, sound effect, and setting up the pipeline for post-process effect like the <b>Worley Noise</b> water shader. <br />

  For removing blocks, I just marched along the look vector of the ray from the camera point and if at any point there's a non-empty block (I used floor to find the bottom left corner coordinates), then I just set it to empty. Similarly for adding block, I also casted a ray, but this time I had to check for face intersections since simple checking if box is empty does not tell me where I need to place the new block.	<br />
  <br />
  I implemented an OpenGL shader first to test my FBM. At first I had a lot of difficulty trying to get it to be smooth and not as noisy, but all it took as dividing by a large number before inputting into the noise function. I also added cosine interpolation for smoother result instead of using mix. <br />

  The post-process effect depended on a frame buffer handle. The scene view is rendered to a frame buffer, which is rendered as a texture on a screen-space quadrangle with a post-process fragment shader applied to it. When the player enters water, the screen is filled with a Worley Noise shader. Jake, one of my teammates, also added a feature in which if player can turn on a 2-pass post-process shader to make the world looks more Japanese-painting like. We did not make this the default shader since it slows down the gameplay. <br />
  <br />
  I moved FBM calculations and creation of chunks to a different thread for faster gameplay. Integrating the river generation into the new thread was tricky since rivers are generated based on a <b>L-System</b> method in which it carves out the landscape, which means that parallel manipulation of data may happen very frequently and if not careful, can lead to lots of problem. <br />
  <br />
  Here are some cool views of the landscape! <br />
